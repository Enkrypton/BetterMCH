Created by [Sound Voltex](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/671884056526323772/784666274625355796/unknown.png) from Aether.

Aimed to be a improved version of the default [Aho's Job Triggers](https://github.com/paissaheavyindustries/Triggernometry/blob/master/Repositories/manifest.xml) for Machinist.

## Drill/Air Anchor 8
Alerts you when there is around 8 seconds (dependent on skill speed) left on Drill and Air Anchor to remind you not to press Hypercharge
## Drill/Air Anchor Ready
Makes a less jarring "beep" when there is 2 seconds left on Drill/Air Anchor. This timing alerts you during the GCD of your last pressed Weaponskill, giving you more time to know that Drill/Air Anchor comes next.
## Wildfire 60
Simple improvement to alert you when Wildfire has 60 seconds left, letting you better manage your heat gauge
## Reassemble
Says "Reassemble Drill" to make more sense. Alerts you around 3 seconds before the Ability comes off cooldown, giving you more time to prepare. 
## Barrel Stabilizer, Wildfire
